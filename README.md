# Advent of Code Bloem

These are my solutions for Advent of Code. ([https://adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com))

_I'm trying to learn to code so, most code won't be very optimized or pretty._

_There is a possibility that some day's don't work anymore because I updated the libraries._

## 2019

I started this year because of this year had some intcode puzzles, and I wanted to try them. And now want to learn rust, so am trying to finish the year.

## 2021

I started this year to begin do python, some of the days will be done with C/C++ because I wanted to.

## 2022

I started this year to begin learning python, some of the days will be done with C/C++ because I wanted to.

## 2023

I started with the advent of code in 2023, and I started with coding in 2024. I practiced my C coding skills mostly with Advent of code.

_Before 2024 started, I had finished day 10. After this, I am first going to commit to 2024._

## 2024

This year is the first year I'm starting when it releases.

## 2025
